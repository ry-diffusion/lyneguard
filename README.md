# Lyneguard
a Proof-of-concept kernel mode that the *real* code can be made propietary anticheat for linux.
This uses GPL Condom to work.


## Wait, this is not a GPL violation?
Probally, I am not a GPL expert but this uses a "GPL Condom" via a Kernel Compatibility Layer so the real module doesn't uses any Kernel GPL Symbol.
